## Getting started:
Install & setup a mysql database, and take note of the username, password, port, and DB name you chose.

Make a copy of `.env_example`, and rename it to `.env` in the root directory, and set the values inside accordingly with the notes you made above.
  - navigate to `backend` and run `npm install`
    - run `npm run dev` to initialize backend server
  - navigate to `client` and run `npm install`
    - run `npm start` to initialize client side server

You can now access the web app from the URL specified in the client side terminal, it will react to your changes automatically.
